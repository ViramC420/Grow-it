Assets are assets, lol, any icons, images, fonts go into the designated folders 
to be used later, except fonts, lol, those are called in _layout.jsx 
in the MAIN app folder, not in any other folder, we dont need to
all of these assets get passed through their own files in the constants folder,
where they get cute lil nicknames that makes referring to them a little more easy
check readme in constants for that
